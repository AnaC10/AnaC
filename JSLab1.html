	<p> Here's a madlib about a kid named <span id = "Julio">Julio</span>  who had an imaginary friend <span id = "name2"> Lilo</span>. One day the two of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> coins </span>.<span id = "name1">Julio</span> and <span id ="Lilo">Lilo</span> went to a <span id ="noun2">town</span> where they both found a lot of shops. While walking towards the <span id="noun4">toy shop</span>, <span id="#Julio">Julio</span> and <span id ="Lilo">Lilo</span> found a <span id = "noun3">cat</span> on their way and both of them decided to play with it for 10 minutes.<br> Once time was up, both <span id="name1">Julio</span> and <span id="name2">Lilo</span> said goodbye to the <span id="noun3">cat</span> and finally entered the <span id="noun4">toy shop</span>, both friends excitedly ran towards the toy ball section. While looking at the different amount of toys, <span id="name1">Julio</span> found a big <span id="noun5">yellow bouncy ball</span> that he wanted to purchase. Grabbing the toy, he makes his way towards the front register where <span id="name3">Mr. Jackson</span> the store manager of the shop was waiting. Taking out the <span id="noun1">coins</span> that <span id="name2">Lilo</span> and him found on top of a hill, <span id="name1">Julio</span> pays 20 <span id="noun1">coins</span> for the toy and leaves the shop happily. Waiting for <span id="name2">Lilo</span> to finish picking out a toy that he liked, his imaginary friend finally left the shop and excitedly looked at the <span id="noun5">yellow bouncy ball</span> he held in his hands. Both of them wanted to play with it, so they started to make their way to the <span id= "noun6">park</span>. 2 hours later, <span id="name1">Julio</span> and <span id ="name2">Lilo</span> where still playing with their new toy until a small <span id="noun7">dog</span> joined them. The three played to their hearts content.</p>
