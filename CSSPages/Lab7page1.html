   <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to what I like to call, *confetti* How well do you know icons Phineas and Ferb? *confetti* </h2>
  <p2 style="font-family:fantasy;">
   Some background info if you forgot who they are:<br> Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother, Ferb Fletcher, are determined to make every day of their summer vacation fun. They try building a full-scale roller coaster, becoming musicians, building a backyard beach, and traveling back in time to meet dinosaurs. Their family pet, Perry the Platypus, doubles as a secret agent and battles evil. Meanwhile, older sister Candace is tattling on them to Mom and Dad, though she can never seem to catch them in the act.</p2>
