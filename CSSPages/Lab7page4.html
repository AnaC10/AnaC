   <h1>Wizards of Waverly Place </h1>
  <h2> Synopsis </h2>
  <p1 style="font-family:serif;">
 The Russo family is just a typical family who run a resturant in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. On the surface they're just typical, but they are actually a family of wizards. Alex, Justin and Max Russo are just trying to be normal in the real world even though they're wizards in training. They gained their magic abilities from their father Jerry Russo, who is their teacher and a former wizard. Yet, only one child from each wizard family can keep their powers. The Russo children would have to compete against each other in the Wizard Competition to decide who gets to keep their powers. </p1>
