<h1> All about Ana Castillo</h1>
      <br>
      <p> Hi, my name is Ana and I am a high school student. I am now in 12th grade, and I am now a senior! </p>
      <br>
      <h2> <em>Things that I like</em></h2>
<p> I like watcing anime,reading manga, playing Roblox and watching Netflix. I enjoy looking at memes and watching funny videos on Youtube. I also like to tell funny jokes to my sister and dad since they are the one who understands them the most. I like being sarcastic to my sister since she is the only one who doesn't take it to heart.</p>
