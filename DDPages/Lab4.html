	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 margarine</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons anise seed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of orange juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of orange zest</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>

  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  </ul>
  <p>1. Heat the milk and the butter together in a medium saucepan, until the butter melts. Remove from the heat and add them warm water. The mixture should be around 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</p>
  <p>2. In a large bowl combine 1 cup of the flour, yeast, salt, anise seed and 1/4 cup of the sugar. Beat in the warm milk mixture then add the eggs and orange zest and beat until well combined. Stir in 1/2 cup of flour and continue adding more flour until the dough is soft.</p>
  <p>3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.</p>
  <p>4. Place the dough into a lightly greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. This will take about 1 to 2 hours. Punch the dough down and shape it into a large round loaf with a round knob on top. Place dough onto a baking sheet, loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until just about doubled in size.</p>
  <p>5. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for about 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven let cool slightly then brush with glaze.</p>
  <p>6. To make glaze: In a small saucepan combine the 1/4 cup sugar, orange juice and orange zest. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 2 minutes. Brush over top of bread while still warm. Sprinkle glazed bread with white sugar.</p>
